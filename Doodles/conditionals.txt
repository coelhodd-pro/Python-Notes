Conditionals:
    It is very common in programming to have to consider different situations
    in order to act properly depending on those situations. For example, let's
    say you're designing a system where if the user is above 18 more functionality
    is available then if the user was below 18. Notice that there's a condition
    in this: If the user is above 18 then let him/her access more functionalities.
    If the user is not above 18 then do not let him/her acess those functionalities.
    This is perfectly normal in programming and it happend quite a lot in computer
    programs, because conditionals allow for the constructing of dynamic programs.

=====

Example of conditional in Python:

    x = 10
    if x > 5:
        print("x is greater than 5")
    else:
        print("x is not greater than 5")

    In this little program, we define a variable carrying the numerical value 10.
    We then procede to analyze if that value if greater than 5 or not, through the
    conditional structure called "if/else"

    With this, we can act accordingly depending on different situations(in this 
    case was comparing a number with a value of interest)
