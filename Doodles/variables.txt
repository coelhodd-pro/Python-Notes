Variables: 
    Variables are containers for storing data inside a computer program.
    In a more technical manner, variables are spaces in memory that we
    utilize in order for our programs to function properly(because programs
    must use computer memory to work).

    For example, when we create a simple program such as grabbing a number
    from the user and printing if its even or odd, we must use at least one
    variable to store the user's input. This variable is a place inside the
    computer's memory where the value the user provided gets stored.

    Every computer program uses memory. Therefore variables are always
    present inside a computer program.
