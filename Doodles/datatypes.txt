Data Types:

    When dealing with computer programs, data types are also always present.
    The reason for that is because data types define expected behaviour inside
    a program. We always know how specific data behave or will behave in a program,
    because data types define such behaviours. 

    In other words, data types are a categorization of each data present inside a 
    program. Depending on the category, the data will have different behaviour.
    For example, we usually have numerical data, text data, structures and so on.
    It is important to know however, that data types vary for each programming
    language. This means that Python has different data types than JavaScript 
    for example(although they are very similar).

Data Types in Python:

    str                             -> Textual data
    int, float, complex             -> Numerical data
    list, tuple, range              -> Sequence data
    dict                            -> Mapping data
    set, frozenset                  -> Set data
    bool                            -> Boolean data
    bytes, bytearray, memoryview    -> Binary data
    NoneType                        -> None data

    ---

    Just like I have described right above, each category define behaviour for
    the data that fits it. For example, with textual data I can do things 
    related to text, such as counting how many letters there are in a word or
    phrase, capitalizing the letters of a word, replacing a letter with another
    one and so on. With numerical data I can check if the number is even or odd,
    perform mathematical operations on it and so on. With boolean data types I
    can use it to deal with true/false situations, such as on/off, and so on.
    I cannot perform calculations to see if a word is even or odd or if a number
    contains the letter "A", because these things are not allowed thanks to data
    types.
