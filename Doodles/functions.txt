Functions:
    Functions are pieces of code that exist independently from the rest of the program.
    A function is basically a functionality of your program. This functionality may be
    something very simple like printing a message, or it could be something more complex
    such as sorting your database depending on a parameter.

    For the concept of functions to be clearer, let's think of this example: Imagine 
    we have a program to register users on our system. We can have a function to ask
    for the user's data, another to provide that data to the database, another to
    search for a specific user inside the database and so on. Notice that each functionality
    of the system exists through a function.

    A function can also receive data so that it can process that data and provide new data 
    to the program. This is possible through parameters and arguments(sending data for the 
    function).

Example of function in Python:

    def addition(a, b):
        return a + b
