Loops:
    Loops are very useful because they will repeat the code inside the structure
    until the condition for the loop to run is false. For example, we can think
    of a situation like this: Imagine a program where we count from 100 to 1. 
    Instead of printing one number after the other, we can create a loop and 
    put code inside of it that will print one number after the other subtracting
    1 each time. This loop will then run until we reach 1.

    A loop always have a condition that makes it run... If that condition is false,
    then the loop will either stop or not be activated at all.

Example of loop in Python:

    # using the program of the example above

    x = 100
    while x >= 1:
        x -= 1
        print(x)

    # this loop will be active until x < 1
