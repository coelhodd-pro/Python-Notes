Different versions of the same system:
(each version will have its script on this folder)

    First Version: 
        Purely using the imperative paradigm.
        In this first version, I'm not thinking in terms of creating 
        a system. I'm just coding. I'm almost thinking like a computer, that is,
        thinking in terms of each step to solve the problem(in this case is to 
        calculate two numbers). Its almost as if I'm figuring it out as I go along.

    Second Version:
        The second version evolves to the structured paradigm.
        This paradigm utilizes code structures to better construct the code itself.
        This feels more like designing a system and less like going step by step.
        Notice that now we have used very defined structures to create the code itself,
        which helps on the understanding of it among other things.
